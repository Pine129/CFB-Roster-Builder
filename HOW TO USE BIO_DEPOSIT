How to use BIO_DEPOSIT.py
Step 1: Install dependencies
  1) Python
  download python 3 at https://www.python.org/downloads/
  2) pandas and playwright 
  open command prompt, input the following commands one at a time, making sure the downloading text pops up
    py -3 -m pip install pandas 
    py -3 -m pip install playwright 
    playwright install 
  3) make sure Firefox is installed if not already
Step 2: Running the program
  1) open up IDLE, which should be installed with python, if you cant find it search for it
  2) in the IDLE window, go to file, click open, and navigate to where you downloaded Navigator.py and select it
  3) A new window pops up with the code, on that window on the top find the RUN tab and select Run Module 
  4) the program should start, on the original IDLE window you should now see blue text asking for an XLSX file.
  5) if you haven't, create a roster file, or generate one with the roster generator program. Look in the RosterExample.xlsx file included on the main branch
  6)More blue text will appear and the program will open Mozilla to the teambuilder homepage.
  7) select get started, input your email and password, then on the IDLE window press enter
  8) once logged in select my teams, then find the team you wish to edit and select edit, wait for the team to load, then select roster.
  9) the program should begin filling out the bio data for each player
Occasionally the generated names or name combinations might be flagged for profanity. If this happens, the program cannot continue. Please watch for this and if the program is stuck on a players page this is probably the reason why.
to fix, simply change the players name to something else. This is rare, maybe 2 players out of a fully generated roster. 
  10) once the program is done, ie once it has no more player data to fill out, it will then save the team and you can go on your day.

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM AND ROSTER GENERATOR ARE TESTED AND BUILT FOR THE CUPCAKE PRESET. IF YOU USE ANY OTHER ROSTER PRESET AND THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS AT A POSITION OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PLAYERS ON THE ROSTER IS DIFFERENT THESE PROGRAMS MIGHT NOT WORK.
