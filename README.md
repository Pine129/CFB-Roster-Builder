You must install panda by going to windows command prompt and typing 
py -m pip install pandas openpyxl
or
python -m pip install pandas openpyxl
This is needed in order to export to Excel.
Included are option name lists I found on the internet. One is a list of 1000 male first names, the other a list of 1000 of the most common last names in the United States. 
If stored in the same spot Python will recognize and use these files for name generation. If you would like to use your own namelists, check to ensure it is formatted like these first.
Then either rename your namelist to first_names.txt or last_names.txt exactly or go inside the code itself and change it to whatever you like.
