You must install panda by going to windows command prompt and typing 
py -m pip install pandas openpyxl
or
python -m pip install pandas openpyxl
This is needed in order to export to Excel.
Included are option name lists I found on the internet. One is a list of 1000 male first names, the other a list of 1000 of the most common last names in the United States. 
If stored in the same spot Python will recognize and use these files for name generation. If you would like to use your own namelists, check to ensure it is formatted like these first.
Then either rename your namelist to first_names.txt or last_names.txt exactly or go inside the code itself and change it to whatever you like.

Update:12/1/25:
I have added a preliminary skill attribute generator that should generate skill values based on position and archetype. 
In Order to use this, download the Json File and Attribute Generator python file and store in the same place as the main file
I have also added skin tone and head generator incase someone wants to use that to decided how their players look.
Please note this is extremely rudimentary and will give values that might be unrealistic to gameplay and actual roster generation in CFB 26
Please leave any feedback, adjustments you would make the weights, and requests to my reddit:
